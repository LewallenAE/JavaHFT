# JavaHFT - High-Frequency Trading Order Book

A high-frequency trading order matching engine demonstrating price-time priority, 
sub-microsecond latency optimization, and production-grade systems architecture.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project synthesizes my mathematical foundations with systems engineering 
principles I'm developing through UPenn's MCIT program. It's designed to 
demonstrate the technical depth expected at firms like Jane Street, Two Sigma, 
and Citadel.

### Core Competencies Demonstrated:

- 📊 **Algorithms**: Price-time priority with O(log n) operations
- ⚡ **Performance**: Nanosecond-level latency tracking and optimization
- 🏗️ **Architecture**: Lock-free data structures, concurrent design patterns
- 📈 **Domain Knowledge**: Market microstructure, order types, trading strategies
- 🔧 **Full Stack**: REST API, WebSocket streaming, interactive dashboard

Built during MCIT coursework to apply data structures (TreeMaps, LinkedLists) 
and systems concepts (concurrency, performance profiling) to a real-world 
financial engineering problem.
